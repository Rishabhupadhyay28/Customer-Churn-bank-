# 🏦 Customer Churn Prediction (Bank Dataset)

This repository contains a basic machine learning project that predicts whether a customer will leave a bank (i.e., churn) based on various customer attributes. This project demonstrates a simple end-to-end supervised learning pipeline using Python.

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is a major issue in the banking sector. Accurately predicting which customers are likely to leave can help banks improve customer retention strategies and reduce losses.

In this project, we use a structured dataset with customer details such as credit score, geography, age, tenure, balance, and more to predict whether a customer has exited the bank.

## 🧾 Dataset Description

The dataset used includes the following features:

| Feature           | Description                              |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| RowNumber         | Index of the row                         |
| CustomerId        | Unique ID for the customer               |
| Surname           | Customer's surname                       |
| CreditScore       | Credit score of the customer             |
| Geography         | Country of the customer                  |
| Gender            | Gender of the customer                   |
| Age               | Age of the customer                      |
| Tenure            | Number of years as a customer            |
| Balance           | Account balance                          |
| NumOfProducts     | Number of bank products used             |
| HasCrCard         | Has a credit card (1=yes, 0=no)          |
| IsActiveMember    | Active membership status (1=yes, 0=no)   |
| EstimatedSalary   | Estimated annual salary                  |
| Exited            | Target variable (1=churned, 0=retained)  |
